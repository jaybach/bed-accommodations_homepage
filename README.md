bed

bed is a (fake) site for budget travelers who don't always want the cheapest option.  bed let's you search hotels, hostels, B&Bs, airbnb-style accommodations, couchsurfing options, etc. all from one website.

Made from scratch (including slogans, etc.; no bootstrap, etc.).

Note:  This site is front end only and is not functional.
Note:  Only tested on Chrome browser.

Future enhancements:
- use Inkscape to make bed logo in upper left look more bed-like (with the b and d as bedposts); keep the "stretched out" look (fits with lying down/stretching out in bed)
- add calendar drop-down for check in and check out boxes
- add options (hotel, etc.) as drop-down box for type of accommodation
- add options re number of rooms and number of guests in drop-down box for number of beds
